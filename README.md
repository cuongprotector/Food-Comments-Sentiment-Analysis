# Food_More_Cmt_Data
this is the dataset I took from a small competition in the subject. The dataset describes the emotions in food comments on the foody.vn website about negative or positive
status. The original data was pretty much missing and I found more data on 1 site: 'https://github.com/congnghia0609/ntc-scv/tree/master/data' which has the original data
as well as dataset top with nearly 20,000 samples with 9985 positive samples and 9999 negative samples
