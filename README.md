# Food_Cmt_Data
This is the dataset I took from a small competition in the subject. The dataset describes the emotions in food comments on the foody.vn website about negative or positive status. The original data was pretty much missing and I found more data on 1 site: 'https://github.com/congnghia0609/ntc-scv/tree/master/data' which has the original data as well as dataset top with nearly 40000samples (include testset and trainset) with 20000 positive samples and 20000 negative samples and I took it for my training (food_train.csv) to have nearly 40000 samples.
In:
  file food_train.csv have 19988 samples with label negative(0) and 19981 samples with label positive(1)
  file test.csv to submit in competition
