# Food_More_Cmt_Data
This is the dataset I took from a small competition in the subject. The dataset describes the emotions in food comments on the foody.vn website about negative or positive status. The original data was pretty much missing and I found more data on 1 site: 'https://github.com/congnghia0609/ntc-scv/tree/master/data' which has the original data as well as dataset top with nearly 40000samples (include testset and trainset) with 20000 positive samples and 20000 negative samples and I took it for my training (food_train.csv) to have enough 40000 samples
I training 2 framework:
  - Kaggle: pyvi-nltk -LSTM(https://github.com/cuongprotector/Food-Comments-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/chl-btl-hm.ipynb)
  - GG Colab: pyvi-nltk -Bi-LSTM(https://github.com/cuongprotector/Food-Comments-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/Bi_LSTM.ipynb)
